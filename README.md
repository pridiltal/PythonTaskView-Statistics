Python Task View for Elements of Statistics is a collaborative open-source project that aims to document best-practice approaches to statistical analysis in Python. This Task View is a set of functions that indicate which Python packages and functions are relevant for a given statistical data analysis task. They are not, however, intended to endorse the "best" tools and practices for any given task.

This Python task view's initial proposed list mirrors a set of widely used statistical data analysis techniques. This may evolve over time to more accurately reflect the grouping of tasks in the Python universe.

The development of this task view is fairly new, still in its early stages and therefore subject to changes. Please send suggestions for additions and extensions to this task view to the task view maintainer.

Functionality	  |    PyPi Link	   | Description
------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
Descriptive Statistics | [statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) |This is a built-in Python library for descriptive statistics. This module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (Real-valued) data.
Descriptive Statistics | [pandas.DataFrame.describe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) | Descriptive statistics include those that summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution
Descriptive Statistics | [Numpy.routines.statitics](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.statistics.html)  | Thi sis third-party library for numerical computing, optimized for working with single- and multi-dimensional arrays. This library contains many routines for statistical analysis.
Descriptive Statistics   |[scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) |  This is a third-party library for scientific computing based on NumPy. This module contains a large number of probability distributions, summary and frequency statistics, correlation functions and statistical tests, masked statistics, kernel density estimation, quasi-Monte Carlo functionality, etc.
